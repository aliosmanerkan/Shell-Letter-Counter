# Simple-Shell-Example

In this script, I implemented a shell script code (named as Q1.sh) to give statistics 
about each word of a given file. This find each word in a line and report  statistics 
about in the given format: x1.x2.x3.x4, where x1 is the total number of uppercase letters 
in the word; x2 is the total number lowercase letters in the word; x3 is the total number 
of digits in the word; x4 is the total number of other characters in the word.  
 
As an example, the statistics regarding the word AOE4034 should be 3.0.4.0.  
If  the  user  does  not  provide  a  filename, then  this script  should  take  the  input  from 
the  standard  input  (keyboard)  until  the  user  enters  Ctrl-D.    Then  it  should  report  the 
statistics  of  each  word  at  each  line.
